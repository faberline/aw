"""What every leg of a change work item has in common.

A change lands in two legs, and `CLAUDE.md` fixes their order: the artifact
that can refuse the work is authored first, and the implementation second. The
ladder is `e2e -> impl`.

The legs differ in what they may write and in what makes them pass. They do not
differ in how a leg is *bounded*, and this module is that part, held once so
that the legs cannot drift into slightly different definitions of the same
word.

What "this change" means
------------------------
A leg's change is **the diff against HEAD**, and that definition holds only
because `start` refuses to open a leg while the working tree is dirty. From a
clean start, whatever `git status` reports is what this leg wrote: the
population is derived from git rather than remembered in a side table, a list
of ids, or a constant inside each artifact. A side table can point at a file
that was deleted and nothing would notice; `git status` cannot.

The same clean start is what lets `C0` refuse a path belonging to a later leg.
Until it existed, "never write `src/**` here" was prose in a skill body, which
is a request rather than a gate.

This module is imported, never invoked. It carries no `main`, and every
function here is one a leg script calls -- so a check that lives here is a
check both legs run, and adding one to a single leg means putting it in that
leg's own script instead.

# Binding to the flow-specific tuple prevents `maint` from becoming a write
# root here and prevents either behavior script from serving maintenance work.
#
# They did disagree, for exactly that reason. This module used to bind two
# names: `LEGS = workitem.LEGS` for the retiring `ec -> td -> cb`, and a
# separately written `PHASES` tuple for the ladder replacing it. That was
# correct while both were live. When the changeover finished and the three
# retired scripts were deleted, only the tuple written here was updated -- the
# one imported from the engine still named the dead ladder, and it is the one
# `change.py --leg` validates against.

# first place, and it is what the filename half of `C0` reads.

# implementation tree. A Python project's tests are already a separate root and
# already separated by the prefix half.
TEST_FILES = ("tests.rs", "tests/mod.rs")

# Which phase must write a test file. One entry, and it is an *existence* rule
# rather than a boundary one.
#
# There used to be two. `unit` required a test file and `logic` was refused
# one, which made the split between writing the invariant and satisfying it a
# filename question -- cheap to enforce, and immune to the judgement calls a
# `#[cfg(test)]` span reader gets wrong (an item-level `#[cfg(test)] fn` reads
# as production; a brace scanner that does not strip `r#"..."#` reads fixture
# text as production). That split is gone: in Rust a colocated test and the
# code it tests are the same tree and are edited together, and holding them in
# two phases meant every green iteration after the first had to pretend to be
# the first.
#
# What survives is the half with no substitute. A phase that wrote no test file
# wrote no test, and every red row below it would then be measured against
# nothing. `impl.py`'s `red` verb carries the other half now, and it carries it
# by measurement rather than by filename: a red can only be recorded at a
# moment when a named test fails, which is a moment the implementation is not
# finished.

# directory. `e2e`'s case inventory is the crate manifest, which sits one level

# false` means a file nobody declared does not run. Without this entry the
# phase would be unable to do its job: `C1` requires the `[[test]]` stanza and
# `C0` would refuse the edit that adds it.
#
# Exact filenames, never a prefix. `apps/<p>/Cargo.toml` is the register; every
# other path outside the root is still the out-of-scope write `C0` exists to

# it. `leg_root` refuses a phase the table has no entry for, which is one
# direction; this is the other, and it is the direction the entries above rotted
# in. `LEG_ROOTS` carried `ec`, `td` and `cb` alongside the live phases for as
# long as the ladder they belonged to had been deleted -- unreachable, because
# `ladder_for` refuses those names, and therefore invisible.
#
# Checked at import rather than in a gate, so it is the exit code of whichever
# script asked, not something a suite has to be run to learn. `LEG_TEST_FILES`
# is a subset by design: `e2e` writes no Rust test file and has no entry. What
