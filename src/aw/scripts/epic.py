"""Read-compatible facade for legacy issue-based epics.

New epics are GitHub Milestones and are managed through `milestone.py`. This
module remains importable while existing `type:epic` issues and verification
snapshots are migrated. Its write verbs refuse, so it cannot create or extend
the old ownership model.

No current skill drives this surface. It stays importable so the legacy epic
schema, terminal-state rule, reconciliation findings, snapshots, and migration
reports remain readable.

Everything that does not know it is serving an epic lives in `workitem.py`
beside this file. What stays here is the epic itself: its sections, its
cross-section coverage rule, its `epic:` ownership prefix, and the four verbs
that mean nothing for a type without children -- `show`'s child readout,
`children`, `reconcile`, and `close`.

The section schema below is a table, not code. Adding `change`, `spike`, or
`report` means a second facade this thin over the same engine, not a copied
verb set.

Verbs
-----
  skeleton   emit the empty section template an epic body must fill
  validate   check a body (by iid or by file) against the section schema
  show       one epic: body, labels, state
  children   the epic's owned child set
  reconcile  read-only findings: structural (computed) and semantic (to ask)
  create     refused; create a release Milestone instead
  update     refused; update a release Milestone instead
  close      refused; close a release Milestone instead

Every write verb refuses before tracker access. The old functions remain below
only because legacy pure-function checks import them while migration is open.
