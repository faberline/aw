"""Refuse a META-doc run that reached outside the project's own documents.

`/aw-grill-me-to-meta` interviews a human and writes prose. Prose is exactly
what no exit code can judge, so this script judges the two things around it
that an exit code *can*: where the run wrote, and what the commit says about
it.

**Where it wrote.** The skill's `## Never` list already says "never write
outside the named project's documents". A `Never` list is a sentence an agent
reads once. `check` is the same claim as a working-tree measurement: the dirty
set against HEAD, every path of it, against one allowlist of four entries --
`README.md`, `STATUS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, and everything under `docs/`. A run
that edited a `src/**` file, another project, or the repository root is refused
here whether or not anyone read the list.

Three of those four were deliberately *excluded* until 2026-08-27, and the
reversal is worth stating rather than quietly inheriting. The reasoning behind
the exclusion was real: the `docs/` sections stand on ids that live in
`STATUS.md` and `ROADMAP.md` and on capability names in the project `README.md`,
so a run that edits both is a run that moved the ground it is standing on in
the same breath. What made the exclusion affordable was a second skill,
`/aw-check-meta`, that a human remembered to run afterwards.

The exclusion is gone because the split was the wrong shape: a promise and the
STATUS row that measures it are one edit, and forcing them into two runs by two
skills meant the second one was the one that got skipped. What replaces it is
not trust. `P7` still resolves every id the sections claim, and `P10` still runs
the product-document contract -- both against the *edited* working tree, so
moving the ground is measured rather than assumed. The check that used to be a
separate skill is now a step in this one's landing sequence, where it cannot be
forgotten:

    metadoc.py check <project>     # this script: allowlist, shape, ids
    meta.py check <project>        # M1-M7 over the edited tree
    metadoc.py commit <project> --why <path>

**What the commit says.** The next skill in the ladder --
`/aw-grill-meta-to-milestone`, which measures the promises against the tracker and
the codebase -- has to find these commits and know what each one touched. It
cannot get that from a hand-written subject line. So `commit` is the only
writer here: it re-runs every check, stages exactly the allowlist, and appends
a trailer block naming the project, every section this commit added, modified,
or removed, and how many of those are still unbound. That makes the history
searchable:

    git log --grep='^Meta-Project: apps/tape'

## What it cannot do

It cannot tell a good promise from a bad one. Every check here is structural:
a path is inside the allowlist or it is not, a bullet is present or it is not,
an id occurs in `STATUS.md` or it does not. Whether the Promise is worth
making, whether the `Open:` questions are the right ones, whether the Problem
is real -- none of that is measurable from the file, and this script does not
pretend otherwise. That judgement stays with the human the skill interviews.

It also cannot prove the run was *authored* by the skill rather than typed by
hand. The allowlist refuses the writes the skill forbids; it says nothing about
who made the writes it permits.

It never writes a document. `commit` writes a commit; nothing here edits a
Markdown file, and a check that could repair what it measures would be a check
that can hide what it measures.

    Three exclusions, and the third is the one that had to be added.

    A directory's own `README.md` is its index, not an area, and the three
    top-level documents are not under `docs/` at all. Both of those matter for
    the same reason: an index measured as an area has no owner bullet and would
    trip `P5` on every run, and a project README measured as one would trip it
    on every heading it owns.

    The third is that **a directory with no index holds no areas**. Until
    2026-08-27 the schema's scope was `docs/product/` and this could not
    arise; widening it to `docs/**` swept in 61 pre-existing reference
    documents across seven projects -- jet's `docs/bundler.md`, mamba's
    `docs/blockers/*`, lumen's `docs/protocol.md`, tape's own
    `docs/deployment-handoff.md` -- none of which is a promise. Measured as
    areas they made `wis.py`'s `G1` row permanently `?` UNMEASURED for every
    one of those projects, because a section with no owner bullet has no kind.

    So the index is the registry. `/aw-grill-me-to-meta` already writes one
    `README.md` per `docs/` directory and refuses a section indexed in the
    wrong directory's; this makes that file the thing that declares its
    directory to hold promises at all. A reference document needs no marker
    and no move -- it just sits in a directory that never got an index.

    The hazard the rule creates is the mirror of the one it fixes: deleting an
    index silently demotes every area beside it, and `P5` stops refusing them.
    That is why `collect()` reports the reference count beside the area count
    rather than dropping the files quietly -- the population line moves when an
    index goes.
