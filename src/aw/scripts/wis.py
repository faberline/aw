"""Measure the distance between what a project promises and what it tracks.

`/aw-grill-meta-to-milestone` and `/aw-grill-milestone-to-issue` read three
things that are supposed to describe the
same product -- the META-docs, the codebase, and the open work items -- and
reorganises the third until it matches the first two. Almost all of that is
judgement: whether a promise deserves a release milestone, whether two open
changes are the same change, whether a surface nobody promised should be
promised or removed. None of it is mechanical and none of it belongs here.

What *is* mechanical is the arithmetic underneath: which promise carries no
milestone number, which milestone no promise points at, which ROADMAP outcome nothing
claims. `gap` prints that table and nothing else. It is the only part of the
skill that can be refused, and the division is deliberate -- a model's opinion
that the backlog "looks about right" is not a measurement, and the way that
opinion becomes indistinguishable from a measurement is a script that prints
both in the same table.

## Why every row prints its population

A gap count of zero has two causes that look identical on a terminal: nothing
is missing, or nothing was read. The second one is the failure mode this file
is built around, because most of its inputs are absent in most projects --
thirty-six of the forty-four `docs/` trees hold no area file at all, only eight
projects have a `STATUS.md`, and `gh` outside a git directory fails with a
non-zero status and an empty stdout that json-decodes to nothing.

So no row is allowed to be silently empty. Each one ends up in exactly one of
two states, and `report` refuses to print a table where any row is in neither:

  * **measured**, with the size of what it read printed beside the count, so
    `0 / 0` is visibly not the same answer as `0 / 12`; or
  * **unmeasured**, printed as `?` with the reason, and counted separately in
    the verdict line so that a run which could not reach the tracker never
    exits 0.

The tracker is the sharpest case. `workitem.gh` raises `GhError` on a non-zero
status, which is what makes "could not ask" distinguishable from "asked, and
the answer was none" -- both of the rows that read the tracker go unmeasured
together rather than reporting an empty backlog.

## Why G1 reads only the future-shaped sections

`metadoc.py` measures a section against one of two shapes, chosen by its owner
bullet: an `Outcome:` section is a promise not yet kept, a `Status rows:`
section is one that has shipped. Only the first kind owes a work item.

That is a measurement, not a preference. Across tape's six area files -- the
only PRD in the repository at the time of writing -- twenty of the twenty-three
sections carry no Milestone binding, and eleven of those twenty are shipped sections
whose work is in the git history rather than on the tracker. A `G1` that
counted every unbound heading would open its first run by demanding eleven
milestones for work that is already done, which is the shape of a gate nobody can
act on and everybody learns to ignore.

## What it does not do

It writes nothing -- not a document, not an issue, not a milestone. The skill's
writes go through `milestone.py` and `change.py`, whose validators own what a body
must contain; a second writer here would be a second answer to that.

It also does not judge a promise. `metadoc.py check` owns whether a section is
well-formed and whether the ids it claims resolve; this file assumes that has
passed and only asks who is standing where. Running `gap` against a project
whose sections have not been checked reads a document whose shape nothing has
established -- the counts will parse, and they will be about the wrong things.
